# Custom Data Structures and types - include first
include("Structs/structs.jl") # Structs used to hold data during training, useful value types, and wrapper types like "BBOpt".
include("Encodings/basis_structs.jl") # Definition of "Encoding", "Basis", etc
include("Structs/options.jl") # Options and MPSOptions types, require the "Encoding" type to be defined. Also defines "TrainedMPS", which requires "MPSOptions" to be defined already.
